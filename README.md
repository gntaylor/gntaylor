## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
My name is Georgia Taylor and I'm a Systems Analyst at Travelers Insurance. I'm in my third year of the Business Insights & Analytics Leadership Development Program.

I currently work on a cloud migration team where I contribute to documentation and governance of assets in preparation for their move to the cloud. I mainly work with SQL in Teradata and
Snowflake, analyzing scripts to identify mapping rules and requirements for data masking and encryption. I also translate field names to business terms and definitions to comply
with the company's master data management governance standards.

In 2022, I graduated Summa Cum Laude from UMass Amherst, majoring in Operations & Information Management, with minors in Economics, Information Technology, and Art History.

I'm learning how to take my baseline Python knowledge and apply it to data analysis and business insights. My goal for the future is to work in a role where I can turn
data into actionable insights and use them to answer real-world business questions.

My technical skills:
 - SQL
 - Snowflake
 - Teradata
 - Microsoft Excel
 - Amazon Web Services
 - QlikView
 - JavaScript
 - SAP
 - R
 - Python
 - SAS
 
My certifications: 
 - AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification
 - SAM Cengage Microsoft Excel Certification
 - SAP Student Recognition Award
